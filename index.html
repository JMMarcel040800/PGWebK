                        I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br>
                        And I fear no evil because I'm blind to it all<br>
                        And my mind and my gun they comfort me<br>
                        Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come<br>
                        Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life<br>
                        And I will dwell on this earth forever more<br>
                        Said, I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul<br>
                        But I can't walk on the path of the right because I'm wrong<br>
                        Well I came upon a man at the top of a hill<br>
                        Called himself the savior of the human race<br>
                        Said he come to save the world from destruction and pain<br>
                        But I said, "How can you save the world from itself?"<br>
                        Because I walk through the valley of the shadow of death<br>
                        And I fear no evil because I'm blind<br>
                        Oh, and I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul<br>
                        But I know when I die my soul is damned<br>

                    <p class="letra">When I was six years old I broke my leg<br>
                    I was running from my brother and his friends<br>
                    And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down<br>
                    I was younger then, take me back to when I<br>
                    Found my heart and broke it here<br>
                    Made friends and lost them through the years<br>
                    And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown<br>
                    But I can't wait to go home<br>
                    I'm on my way<br>
                    Driving at ninety down those country lanes<br>
                    Singing to "Tiny Dancer"<br>
                    And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real<br>
                    We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill<br>
                    Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes<br>
                    Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends<br>
                    Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right<br>
                    But I was younger then, take me back to when<br>
                    We found weekend jobs, when we got paid<br>
                    We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight<br>
                    Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown<br>
                    But I can't wait to go home<br>
                    I'm on my way<br>
                    Driving at ninety down those country lanes<br>
                    Singing to "Tiny Dancer"<br>
                    And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real<br>
                    We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill<br>
                    Over the castle on the hill<br>
                    Over the castle on the hill<br>
                    One friend left to sell clothes<br>
                    One works down by the coast<br>
                    One had two kids but lives alone<br>
                    One's brother overdosed<br>
                    One's already on his second wife<br>
                    One's just barely getting by<br>
                    But these people raised me and I can't wait to go home<br>
                    And I'm on my way, I still remember<br>
                    This old country lanes<br>
                    When we did not know the answers<br>
                    And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real<br>
                    We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill<br>
                    Over the castle on the hill<br>
                    Over the castle on the hill<br>
